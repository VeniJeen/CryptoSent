      "I'd say pick the current top two or three in each respective field. You need BTC and ETH, obviously, but outside that you need exposure in defi, linking protocols, exchanges and stablecoins at the least. Diversity is the key, and prioritising BTC followed by ETH and then putting a total of 10-20% of your total in others is probably as secure as it gets. That's a long term view. Short term, yeah, whatever Shibu/Elon/moon tat you want could do well, if you can time the market. Lol.\n",
      "Don’t sell XMR cuz privacy will become more popular soon. AXS is likely over priced now so sell that\n",
      "In June, I had quite a few alt coins, and they were tanking faster than more-stable currencies. Rather than panic selling, I decided on four currencies I wanted to keep and then sold the others when it was financially advantageous.  In other words, BAT was higher (relative to what I paid for it) than XLM was (relative to what I felt it was worth), so I sold BAT and immediately bought XLM. It was a pain in the ass to numerically establish my buy/sell points, and it was not perfectly executed. Overall, I am ahead (relative to the current market), but holding two of the less-desirable tokens would have paid off. The other tokens are still in the bottom of a clogged sewer line, somewhere. Consolidation worked for me, but I'm holding for at least 10 years. If you're looking for short-term gains at much higher risk, spreading yourself thin could win the lottery, and it could also end up as a casino profit statistic.\n",
      "If you only have small investments in the 16 altcoins you mentioned, my thought would be that you'd really only need two or three to moon to cover your losses even if all the others completely flop. Granted I don't know enough about most of those 16 to make an educated suggestion regarding what to drop, but you must've believed at least a little in each of those projects to put your money into them.\n",
      "I like the aggressive mindset of the person saying to consolidate everything into ETH, but I think it’s going a bit far and it’s also questionable putting all your eggs in one basket (no matter how stable ETH is compared to everything besides BTC).\n",
      "\n",
      "I would keep your BTC, ETH, and your 3 staking coins. I would then pick 4 of the remaining alts. LINK, DOT, THETA, and SOL. Those are blue chip alts and I think it’s crazy to get rid of them.\n",

      "That will trim your portfolio from 21 to 9 and I think that is a reasonable purge that is not eliminating everything but one crypto.\n",
      "\n",

      "Literally sell them all for ETH. Keep BTC, ETH, and the three other altcoins you’re staking if you must, the rest needs to go.\n",
      "I say keep them all. As long as you have over 50% in ETH/BTC.\n",

It's got to have some kind of unique selling point, it's got to have a real world use that nothing else does, and it's got to have active development and some results already for me to be interested.
