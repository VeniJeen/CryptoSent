Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data for Predicting Cryptocurrency Market Behavior 
by Veniamin Tzingizis - Technical University of Denmark

The thesis explored the interplay between sentiment from social media and the behaviour of the cryptocurrency market. 
The dataset was collected from Reddit spawning from 2019 to June 2021 and containing over $16$ million posts and comments. 
The sentiment was extracted by various state-of-the-art neural network methods based on the BERT architecture. 
The relationship between the sentiment and Bitcoin's price found to be complex which makes the creation of a 
deterministic system that explains it challenging. Although the interaction is complex, the results show that the sentiment
 can be a significant indicator for predicting the price of Bitcoin. Findings from the heuristic search showed that the appropriate
 combination of a multidimensional emotion-based sentiment with additional multiple binary sentiment signals could provide promising results. 
Moreover, it was found that popularity-related indexes, combined with the most up-voted posts, improved the predictions even further. 
Additionally, the sentiment from many non-expert users produced superior predictions than the sentiment from a few experts.
 Results propose that for different periods performance is lower because the relationship between the sentiment and the price is not the same for all periods.
 Although high-performance results can be achieved by using social media sentiment, that is not always the case, and predictions can be volatile.
